# Resume Website
Welcome to my personal website that showcases my resume and portfolio! This website is designed to give you an idea of my skills, interests, and experiences.

## API

One of the features of my website is a button labeled "Want to know a fun fact?" that triggers an API call. When you click the button, a random poem will be displayed. If you click the button again, a new random poem will be generated.

The API is linked to a Cosmos DB database that stores the poems. This allows for fast and efficient retrieval of the poems whenever the button is clicked.

## Technologies Used

Here are the technologies that were used to create my website:

### HTML/CSS: 
These are the foundational languages used to create the structure and layout of my website.


### JavaScript: 
This programming language was used to add interactivity to my website, such as the API call and button functionality.


### Cosmos DB: 
This NoSQL database was used to store the poems used in the API.
